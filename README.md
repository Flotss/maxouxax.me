## Project setup

## Serving the website locally for development

The following command will serve the website locally, automatically open your browser and leverage the power of VueJS and Cloudflare Pages (especially Cloudflare Pages Functions)

```bash

```

### General guidelines when contributing

- First, you of course need to fork the repository, then clone that forked repository on your local machine.

- Before you start coding anything, make sure to create a new branch for your changes.

  💢 Please name your branch after the following pattern:

  - `feature/<feature-name>` - If you are adding a new feature
  - `fix/<issue-number>` - If you are fixing an existing issue

- Once you successfully tested your changes, you can push your changes to the remote repository and create a pull request describing your changes clearly.
